# Retail_Store_Sales

## Abstract
The forecasting of sales forms the foundation of maximizing profits and successful planning operation at the start of the fiscal year for Business to consumer (B2C) models like Walmart retail chain. It is paramount for such companies to understand the needs and buying pattern of their customers. This paper puts forth some crucial sales visualizations that can prove indispensable to a store manager and performs a comprehensive evaluation of the different forecasting models to predict sales of a retail chain. One of the chief goals of the paper is to determine prediction models that can accommodate the seasonality in sales during four holidays.


## Overview
Three datasets provided by Walmart spanning a time period of 3 years were used for this paper. First dataset consisted details of the sales made by a particular department of a specific store on that date, aggregated weekly. Second dataset comprised of the features like fuel price, temperature, markdowns, consumer price index (CPI), unemployment rate and if it was a holiday at that particular date in the specific store. Last dataset provided the type and area of the different stores of Walmart.
The implementation is divided into three sections. First is visualization insights that mangers can use to make preliminary conclusions about their store sales. Second has data cleaning and feature extraction steps to make the data model ready. Third section consists of a comparison of different prediction models to determine the most accurate one for this scenario.
